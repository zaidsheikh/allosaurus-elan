## [Allosaurus](https://github.com/xinjli/allosaurus/) (universal phone recognizer) extension for [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan)

###  Note

This is very early code, still a work-in-progress, let us know if you notice bugs or have any feedback or feature requests.

### Instructions
Download and extract ELAN
```
wget https://www.mpi.nl/tools/elan/ELAN_6-1_linux.tar.gz
tar xzf ELAN_6-1_linux.tar.gz
```

Copy this repo to ELAN's extensions dir/
```
cd ELAN_6-1/lib/app/extensions/
git clone https://github.com/zaidsheikh/allosaurus-elan
```

Start ELAN with the provided test audio file

`ELAN_6-1/bin/ELAN allosaurus-elan/test/allosaurus.wav &`

Switch to the "Recognizers" tab and then select "Allosaurus Phoneme Recognizer" from the Recognizer dropdown list at the top and then click the "Start" button. ELAN will prompt you to load the output tier generated by the recognizer. Once that's done, you should be able to see the phoneme transcriptions in the timeline viewer.

If the audio file is long, you can use an existing audio segmenter (for example, the "Fine audio segmentation" recognizer in ELAN) to segment the audio into utterance level segments first. Once that's done, before you run the "Allosaurus Phoneme Recognizer", in the "Parameters" section set the input tier to the audio segmenter output tier generated previously (for example: "Fine_Segmentation" tier).
